# Boolean 
Social space in which people can upload article pieces, news etc. 

## How to use
You will need to download Xampp <a href = "https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html">here</a> and install MySQL and Apache in Xampp. 

Now you will need to look for the following Directory in your files:

<pre>C:\xampp\htdocs</pre>

Once done, you will download this repository in that folder:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/valle-code/Boolean</pre>

Once you've downloaded the project, you have to start both MySQL and Apache services in Xampp. Then you will look for this link in your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox...):

<pre>http://localhost/phpmyadmin/</pre>

In that link you have to import my <strong>boolean.sql</strong> file inside "Datos" folder from my project you've already downloaded. After doing that you will look for this link in your browser:

<pre>http://localhost/boolean/index.php</pre>

Now you should see the main page and be ready to go.
